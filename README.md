I’m a researcher at the University of Adelaide. My research area is particle physics theory, with a focus on high-energy collider physics and its connection with astroparticle physics and cosmology. By building theoretical models of elementary particles and their interactions, and developing strategies for testing theories through experimental and observational methods. This research direction that connects abstract theory and experimental observation is called phenomenology.
<br/>
The questions that I think about from theory and seek answers for in experiments mainly include:
- Higgs mechanism, electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass;
- Fundamental interaction forces and gauge grand unification;
- Symmetry and its breaking mechanism: gauge symmetry, supersymmetry and CP violation, etc.;
- The natural nature of dark matter particles.

Now I am interested to automating the calculating in High Energy Physics. Currently, I contribute to Gambit and also develop my own projects Jarvis-HEP.
